    readme -- Generate a readme listing changes to modules and packages.

    sak readme ?-md? ?-I|-intro file? ?-D|-deprecations file?

    	-md:   	     	     Generated markdown instead of plain text
	-intro        file:  Insert file content before generated text
	-deprecations file:  Insert file content just before changes section

    	This command compares the current state of the modules and
    	packages and against information from the last release
    	(support/releases/PACKAGES) and generates a README.txt listing
    	the relevant changes (new modules/packages, package version
    	changes, unchanged packages).

	The generated README is written to stdout.

	This is a support command for the release manager.
