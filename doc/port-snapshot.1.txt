NAME
----
port-snapshot -  Manage snapshots of installed ports.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-vdN*] *snapshot*
    [--create [--note <note>]]
    [--list] [--diff 'snapshot-id' [--all]]
    [--delete 'snapshot-id'] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*port snapshot* creates and manages snapshots of installed ports. Snapshots
record information about the ports that are installed when the snapshot is
created, and can be used by *port restore* to return to that previous state
at a later time.

OPTIONS
-------
*--create*::
Create a new snapshot that records the currently active ports. This is
the default if no options are given.

*--note <note>*::
When creating a snapshot, it will be labelled with the given note.

*--list*::
Display a list of all snapshots that currently exist, with their ID
numbers, creation dates, and associated notes.

*--diff ID*::
Display the differences between the given snapshot ID and the currently
installed ports.

*--all*::
Consider all ports when displaying diffs. By default, only
differences in requested ports are shown.

*--delete ID*::
Delete the snapshot with the given ID number.

*--help*::
Display brief usage information.
