DESCRIPTION
-----------
*port migrate* will reinstall the base MacPorts system and installed ports
if they are not compatible with the current platform. It should be run
after updating to a new major OS version, or after transferring a MacPorts
installation to a computer with a different CPU architecture.

OPTIONS
-------

*--all*::
Migrate all ports including unrequested ones. By default, only requested
ports and their dependencies are migrated.

*--continue*::
Continue with migration of ports. Normally only used internally when running
the new copy of MacPorts base after it is rebuilt.
